# Archival Bot

Simple bot that will store the text, metadata and media of certain tweets on IPFS. You can summon it be mentioning _@watchdogedao_ as a reply to the tweet you want to archive.
It will only work if your twitter account has been whitelisted by the DAO.

# Usage

You will need credentials for a twitter app, and access tokens for the account that will do the tweeting. There's a .env.example file to help.
